    "## How does k-Nearest Neighbors Work\n",
    "- The kNN algorithm is belongs to the family of instance-based, competitive learning and lazy learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance-based algorithms are those algorithms that model the problem using data instances (or rows) in order to make predictive decisions. The kNN algorithm is an extreme form of instance-based methods because all training observations are retained as part of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a competitive learning algorithm, because it internally uses competition between model elements (data instances) in order to make a predictive decision. The objective similarity measure between data instances causes each data instance to compete to “win” or be most similar to a given unseen data instance and contribute to a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lazy learning refers to the fact that the algorithm does not build a model until the time that a prediction is required. It is lazy because it only does work at the last second. This has the benefit of only including data relevant to the unseen data, called a localized model. A disadvantage is that it can be computationally expensive to repeat the same or similar searches over larger training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, kNN is powerful because it does not assume anything about the data, other than a distance measure can be calculated consistently between any two instances. As such, it is called non-parametric or non-linear as it does not assume a functional form."

    "__k-Nearest Neighbors is a very commonly used algorithm for classification, regression and for imputing missing values__. It works great when you have large amount of classes and a few samples per class.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__kNN in one sentence__: is an algorithm that classifies or calculates a regression based on the items in the training set that are 'closer' to each of the testing points.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "k Parameter - Size of Neighborhood<br>\n",
    " - k represents the amount of neighbors to compare data with. That is why it usually k is an odd number.<br>\n",
    " - the bigger the k, the less 'defined' or more smooth are the neighborhoods.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Distance__ is a key factor in order to determine who is the closest. Distance impacts the size and characteristics of the neighborhoods.  The most commonly used is Euclidean distance since it gives the closest distance between 2 points.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Most Common Distances<br>\n",
    " - Euclidean: the shortest distance between to points that might not be the best option when features are normalized. Typically used in face recognition.<br>\n",
    " - Taxicab or Manhattan: is the sum of the absolute differences of the Cartesian coordinates of 2 points. It works the same way as when a car needs to move around 'blocks' to get to the destination.<br>\n",
    " - Minkowski: is a mix of both Euclidean and Manhattan.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The amount of features impacts kNN significantly because the more points we have, the more 'unique' each neighborhood becomes. It also affects speed because we need to measure each distance first in order to determine who are the closest k neighbors.<br)"
